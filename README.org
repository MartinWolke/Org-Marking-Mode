#+TITLE Org Marking Mode

* What is this?
This is an Emacs minor mode I use to make marking student papers just a little easier and more convenient for myself.

* Requirements
This mode relies on org, org-babel, and org-attach, and also loads cl just in case.

* How do you use it?

~org-marking-mode.el~ defines a few functions for parsing csv files, and using that output to populate an org-mode file with a series of subtrees. It als oprovides functions for mailing comments out to students, in bulk.  ~Grading-template.org~ shows how one might use marking mode in a more-or-less real-world situation.

This README is just a stub, and the mode is not really flexible enough for other people to use just yet.  But I hope it eventually will be.
